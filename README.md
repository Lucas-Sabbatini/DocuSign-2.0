# DocuSign 2.0

Everyday, complicated documents requiring e-signature create friction in people's business and personal lives. Think tax forms, sales agreements, mortgages, employment contracts, NDAs, loan applications, insurance applications, and more.

## The Problem

When using DocuSign or similar products today, it's too hard to:

- Create a document template
- Avoid filling out duplicate information
- Correct document errors
- Get an explanation of complicated terms
- Integrate into other software products

## Our Vision

We want founders to rethink how documents should be created and distributed for signature in a world powered by AI.

Imagine a new set of tools that could:

- Take any existing signed document, remove the variables of your choosing, and create a new document template.
- Auto fill documents with information youâ€™ve provided in the past or that is publicly available about you.
- Allow you to fill out complicated documents with a voice agent that can explain hard-to-understand terms or conditions.
- Have document templates that customize themselves to the signer and situation.
